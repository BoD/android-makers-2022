# AndroidMakers 2022 will host some "Office hours"

During this year event, we are going to have some Office hours lead by experts on specific topics. You are all invited to join these office hours to ask them any question about their area of expertise.

## What are the office hours?

The office hours will gather some speakers to answer your questions on specific topics.<br/>
Each session will last 50 minutes and will be lead by two speakers within their field of expertise. Everyone can join, talk and ask them about specific problems they encountered.

## What do I need?

You need to have your questions ready. You can bring drawings, wireframes, or even your laptop.<br/>
