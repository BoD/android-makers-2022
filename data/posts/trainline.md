We have created a tech organisation that is capable of innovating for our customers. We organise around strategical themes and architectural domains and empower our Tech teams to own more than 300 production releases per week.
Our established Tech team of experts build scalable solutions that make a world-class customer experience for our app and website. We’re a data-driven business that’s relentless in analysing how we can drive further value for our customers.
We take the complexity of rail and bring it into one seamless experience for our users through smart tech, making rail and coach travel easier. We host more than 90m visits across our platforms each month – selling tickets on behalf of 270 rail and coach companies across 45 countries to customers based in over 175 countries.
We’ve focused on building a culture of innovation throughout our squads while ensuring we have the cutting-edge technology at the back end to power it.
